# Title IDs

The following is a list of Title IDs for LBP2 and its respective Cross-Controller client. All names are in the native language for that region. European copies will use English for the names as default. The Cross-Controller application only works with the Title ID for the game that the application comes with. For example, an LBP2 UK Disc Cross-Controller application won't work with LBP2 Extras Digital Edition.

| Game Name | Title ID | Cross Controller ID | Cross Controller Name (LiveArea™) | Note |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|----------------------------------|------|
| LittleBigPlanet™2 Extras Digital Edition | NPEA00437 | PCSF00287 | LittleBigPlanet™2 Cross-Controller |
| LittleBigPlanet™2 (UK) | BCES01086 | PCSF00281 | LittleBigPlanet™2 Cross-Controller |
| リトルビッグプラネット™２ | BCJS30058 | PCSC80015 | LBP 2　クロスコントローラー | Despite being a Japanese copy, it can also be played in English |
| LittleBigPlanet™2 (EU) | BCES00850 | PCSF00280 | LittleBigPlanet™2 Cross-Controller |
| LittleBigPlanet™ Hub (EU) | BCET70055 | N/A | N/A | Leaked build, has Cross-Controller support but no Cross-Controller Application, Causes C0-14347-9 when trying to download the app onto the Vita due to the lack of a `CROSSDIR` in the game's files |

This list is incomplete and lacks a lot of Title IDs, so if you have a copy of LBP2 and a Vita that is not on this list, please let me know.
